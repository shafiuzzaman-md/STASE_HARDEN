Create a functioning KeyVault

Where is the stack pointer at the vulnerable return?
Find the stack frame boundaries for Smi function calls
Find a valid address for the stack pointer redirect
    - must be relatively close to the vulnerable return
    - must not be overwritten by other stack frames
    - should have the target address assigned it at some point
